          <h1>Core Statement</h1>
          <p>
            <b>Villainous Investments</b> is an <b> Isometric City Builder</b> with an evil twist.
            Players take the role of a greedy businessman trying to get money in any way possible.
            <br />
            <br />
            My main goal for this project was to learn more about systems design.
            City builder games have dense, interconnected systems, so I decided to make a game in that genre for design practice.

        <h2>Game Pillars</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Being Bad Feels So Good:</b> Every option at the player’s disposal has a dark twist.
          In a world where nice guys finish last, only the ruthless can survive and thrive.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Comedic Tone:</b> While we want the player to feel evil, there’s a spectrum of how evil.
          We want to embody the mischief of Despicable Me, not Wolf of Wall Street.
          If we can convince a single player to laugh manaically, then this game has been a success.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Power Has its Perks:</b> Players should feel their progress in ways beyond the average game.
          Gaining abilities should have game changing effects that make the player feel rich and powerful.
          Only the most corrupt players will earn the right to influence the in-game rules!
        </p>
        <br />

        <h1>Contributions</h1>
        <p>
          Below are details of the specific designs I created for the project and my thought process behind them.
        </p>
        <h2>Concept</h2>

        <p>
          <b>Villainous Investments</b> was initially planned to be a hybrid city builder/FPS shooter where you played as a Scooby Doo style villain that kept property values low through underhanded means.
          After playtesting it became apparent that this concept was over scoped.
          I cut the FPS content as it was in earlier stages and incorporated its tone into the main game.
        </p>
        <!-- Blockquote
  <blockquote>
    <h2>Design Process Summary</h2>
    CatMouse vs MouseBoard started as a challenge to make a local multiplayer game with no dedicated controllers but quickly evolved into something more. Various parts of the project completely changed the game until it became the product you see here.
    Some of those design decisions include:
    <ul>

      <il>&bull;Established a design credo early to keep the overall vision consistent throughout the project</il>

      <il>&bull;Changed the controls from a menmonic scheme to one that created a unique experience</il>

      <il>&bull;Balanced gameplay based on a variety of factors including input method intuitiveness</il>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
          <h2>Project Goals</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>&bull;Create an original game that fit the challenge theme</li>
            <li>&bull;Improve programming skills by building unorthodox gameplay</li>
            <li>&bull;Recapture the magic from childhood memories of playing local multiplayer games</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>System Design</h3>
          <p>
            I created 5 connected systems to mimic the issues an evil capitalist might face: Land Worth, Rivals, Investment Stocks, Unforeseen Events, and Citizen Approval.

            <h2>Land Worth System</h2>
          <p>
            This game is about buying and developing a new city in dastardly and underhanded ways.
            That’s why I made the Land Worth System, to reflect aspects of the real-world real estate market.
            Each building the player purchases changes Land Worth both positively and negatively, resulting in the following effects:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              •	<b>Dynamic Building Pricing:</b> The first rule of real estate is location, location, location.
              That’s why more desirable properties are more expensive than less desirable locales.
              As the player places money generating buildings, the area they are in costs more to develop.
              Conversely negative Land Worth buildings cost money to maintain but lower the price of other buildings in the area. I made these buildings have negative effects on the area around them to add weight to the player’s decision of where to place them.
              I wanted players to balance making their world a better place and raking in obscene profits.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              •	<b>Enemy Rival Investors:</b> In the real world the price of real estate changes its customers.
              That doesn’t affect the people who already own property in that area.
              To accomplish this, I added computer controlled “Rivals” that have different behavior depending on Land Worth when they spawn.
              You can read more in the next section.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              •	<b>Available Events:</b> The price of real estate in the real world influences the events that can take place there.
              I wanted to reflect this in Villainous Investments, so I added events that are locked to specific Land Worth ranges.

            </li>
          </ul>

        </div>

        <div class=" container">
          <div class=" container">
            <div class="image"></div>
            <img src=" images/portfolio/Villainous Investments/Rival Screenshot.png" width="500" alt="Rival Screenshot'" style=margin-right 10px; />
            <br />
            <h3>Rival System</h3>
            <p>
              Buying real estate can be a cutthroat business.
              To simulate this in Villainous Investments I created the Rival System.
              <br />
              If Rivals aren’t eliminated by the player, they’ll take valuable real estate and can use stocks in the player’s company to attempt a hostile takeover.
              Players can defeat them either by bankrupting them performing a hostile takeover with Investment Stocks.
              <br />
              I made the Rivals that spawn beginning of the game easier, but I didn’t want them to be pushovers forever.
              These Rivals unlock unique behaviors after some time because I wanted to keep them relevant and engaging for the player.
            </p>

            <div class="image"></div>
            <img src=" images/portfolio/Villainous Investments/Investment Screenshot.png" width="500" alt="Rival Screenshot'" style=margin-right 10px; />

            <h3>Investment Stocks</h3>
            <p>
              Company shares are the lifeblood of capitalism, so I wanted to include them in Villainous Investments.
              Its literally in the title!
              This system allows players and Rivals to gain passive income and attempt a hostile takeover.
              If either party has over 70% of the shares for a building, they can steal that asset.
              If this is the Rivals last building they are defeated, but if it’s the player’s last building they get a game over.
              In the real world this is seen as an underhanded tactic, making it perfect for this game.

            <br />
            <h3>Situation System</h3>
            <p>
              The real world is full of unforeseen events, like a power outage crashing the stock market.
              I wanted to incorporate that type of randomness into Villainous Investments, so I created the situation system.
              This acts like the chance cards in Monopoly, with effects that are both beneficial and detrimental for the player.
              The types of events available depend on a variety of factors including the current land worth and active Rivals.
              Below is a table of some sample events:


            </p>
            <table>
              <tr>
                <th>Event Name</th>
                <th>Event Effect</th>
                <th>Event Text</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Orphanage Grand Opening</td>
                <td>
                  Rival Opens Orphanage (Building Type: Housing, Cost $100k, Profit $0).
                  Citizen Happiness goes down after Orphanage closes depending on how long it is open
                </td>
                <td>
                  Your goody two shoes Rival just opened an Orphanage.
                  How vile. Bankrupt them before people get too attached
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>For Sale</td>
                <td>
                  Players get the choice to sell their lowest earning building for double the price
                </td>
                <td>
                  Someone sees potential in your least valuable asset and are willing to pay double the price for it.
                  Do you accept their deal?
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Cultural Moment</td>
                <td>
                  Random building gets +20% profit until the end of the financial quarter and Citizen Happiness +20
                </td>
                <td>
                  Someone shot a video that has gone viral in one of your businesses.
                  The people are as joyous as your wallet
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <br />

            <div class="image"></div>
            <img src=" images/portfolio/Villainous Investments/Citizen Screenshot.png" width="500" alt="Screenshot of Citizen System'" style=margin-right 10px; />

            <h3>Citizen Happiness</h3>
            <p>
              CEOs in the real world must balance maximizing profits with their public image.
              I wanted player’s experience this while also making them question their morals along the way.
              Citizens are NPCs that help keep the city running.
              If Citizen Happiness is too high, they might start asking for raises or taking time off.
              Conversely if its too low they won’t show up for work or may get poached by a Rival.
              It was important to me to figure out how to make the player evil.
              Creating people that feel the consequences of the player’s actions helped accomplish this.
